Core Concept: Use GPT-4o-mini to generate instructions for the computer-use agent based on natural language queries

What We've Built:

âœ… Dynamic prompt generation - GPT-4o-mini creates task-specific instructions
âœ… Dynamic model creation - Pydantic models generated on-the-fly for any data structure
âœ… WebKit browser automation - Launches and navigates automatically

Proof of Concept:

Understand ANY query ->
Generate its own instructions ->
Navigate websites with computer vision ->
Extract relevant data VISUALLY ->
Handle different data types ->
Save structured results ->

Result:  successfully navigated Newegg (with all its anti-bot measures) using computer-use-preview and playeright and extracted real product data without websearch
